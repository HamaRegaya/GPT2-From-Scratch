# GPT2-From-Scratch
<h1>GPT-2 From Scratch</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of training and text generation using a miniature GPT-2 model. The project is designed to be informative and educational, catering to both beginners and experienced individuals in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing.</p>

<h3>What is a Language Model?</h3>

<p>In "The Illustrated Word2vec," we explored the concept of a language model - a machine learning model capable of predicting the next word based on a given context. Famous examples include smartphone keyboards that suggest words as you type.</p>

<p>In this context, GPT-2 can be seen as an advanced version of such predictive keyboards. Trained on a massive 40GB dataset called WebText, GPT-2 is significantly larger and more sophisticated than typical keyboard models.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>The main goal of this project is to understand and experiment with training a language model using the GPT-2 architecture, leveraging text data to autonomously generate coherent text.</p>

<h2>Contents and Methodology</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Importation and Installation</strong>: The notebook begins by installing necessary libraries and importing modules to set up a suitable development environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Configuration</strong>: Detailed configuration parameters such as model size, number of heads, and layers are established to meet project requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Loading</strong>: A specific dataset, tailored for the miniature model, is loaded for training and testing purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Creation</strong>: A custom model class is defined using the GPT-2 architecture, adapted for a miniature model to generate relevant text.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization and Training</strong>: The AdamW optimizer is employed for model training, with a detailed training loop covering multiple epochs.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation and Visualization</strong>: Model performance is evaluated by analyzing the loss curve during training, aiding understanding of convergence and learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Generation</strong>: A demonstration of text generation is provided, showcasing the model's ability to create text from specific input data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results Analysis</h2>
